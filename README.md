In the process of developing this To-Do list app, I learned and applied several Android development concepts and tools, including:

- Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication
- Data binding
- View binding
- SharedPreferences
- Navigation component
- TimePicker
- Using Material Design components to create a polished and modern UI
- To implement a bottom sheet to add new items to the database
- To use RecyclerView to display a dynamic list of items
- Lottie animations
